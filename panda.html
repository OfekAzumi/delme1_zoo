    <h2>The Amazing Giant Panda</h2>
    <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a beloved and iconic species native to the mountains of central China. Renowned for its distinctive black-and-white fur and charming appearance, the panda is one of the world's most treasured animals.</p>
    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Giant pandas have a stocky build with round faces, small eyes, and large, round ears. Their black patches around the eyes, ears, and on their limbs contrast beautifully with the white fur covering most of their bodies. Adult pandas typically weigh between 80 to 150 kilograms (176 to 330 pounds) and can reach a length of about 1.2 to 1.9 meters (4 to 6 feet).</p>

    <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>Pandas primarily inhabit dense bamboo forests located at elevations of 1,200 to 3,500 meters (3,900 to 11,500 feet) above sea level. Bamboo constitutes around 99% of their diet, and they consume vast amounts of it daily to meet their energy needs. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas' diet is almost exclusively herbivorous.</p>
    <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Due to habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as other threats such as poaching, the giant panda was listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, thanks to extensive conservation efforts, their numbers have been slowly increasing, and they were reclassified as vulnerable in recent years.</p>
